# Movie_Recommendation_System

In this project, I worked on a Movie Recommendation System.


**The Question**

How do we show the most anticipated and recommended list of movies to a user based on their choice and search for a particular movie in an inclusive and optimized way?


**Motivation**

One reason is that they can help people find new and interesting movies to watch. They can also help people avoid watching movies that they might not enjoy. Additionally, movie recommendation systems can help movie studios and distributors make better decisions about which movies to produce and release.


**Approach**

There are different kinds of movie recommendations followed in the market. A few of them are Content-Based Recommendation, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid. In this project, the effort is to implement the Content-Based recommendation, where we recommend the movies based on the content of the movie that the user selects. In addition to the recommended movie, also shows the user the overall top five popular movies that users may like based on the popularity column of the dataset.


**Our hypothesis**

Our recommended movies will be shown based on the user entry choice which implies that the top movies in which the mega tag field in the data set greatly matches the particular tag field of the input movie, we calculate the mega tag field by using 500 entries in the dataset.


**Data**
